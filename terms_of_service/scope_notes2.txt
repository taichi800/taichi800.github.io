Here are interaction and publishing strategies that stay low risk under evolving UK or AUS rules because they avoid user-to-user scope, avoid non-essential device storage, and keep third parties out. I include short “why it survives” notes and the exact policy lines to publish. At the end, I give ready-to-paste HTML sections you can add to your scope page.
A. Strategies that are resilient to new laws

    Mail-to-publish letters
    Why it survives: nothing auto-publishes, so your site is not user-to-user.
    Policy line: “Reader emails are curated and edited. Nothing is auto-published. By sending a letter for publication you grant a non-exclusive license to publish edited excerpts. You can withdraw consent and we will remove where reasonably practicable.”

    Periodic digest
    Why it survives: you publish your own edited summaries at a fixed interval.
    Policy line: “We publish edited monthly digests of selected correspondence. Sources are email submissions. No live comments.”

    PR-to-publish, manual merge only
    Why it survives: publication is editorial, not automatic.
    Policy line: “Proposed edits via pull requests are reviewed and may be rejected without reply. Nothing is auto-published.”

    Read-only Q&A
    Why it survives: you answer questions you received by email, then publish as static pages.
    Policy line: “Questions are received by email and answered at our discretion. We edit for clarity and privacy.”

    Local, site-only search
    Why it survives: search runs entirely on the client against a local index of your own pages, no telemetry, no external calls. This is not a “search service” under the OSA.
    Policy line: “Any search is limited to this site and runs locally in your browser. No queries are sent off site. No cookies are set.”

    Click-to-load embeds
    Why it survives: third-party content loads only after an explicit click, and you store no preference.
    Policy line: “External media loads only after you click. We do not remember the choice. No non-essential storage.”

    RSS or JSON Feed instead of newsletters
    Why it survives: no emails sent, no mailing lists, no consent management.
    Policy line: “Updates are available via RSS and JSON Feed. We do not operate email newsletters.”

    Static polls and feedback by email
    Why it survives: no live widgets, no tracking.
    Policy line: “Feedback is collected by email. We publish aggregated results in digests.”

    Federated presence without hosting an instance
    Why it survives: you do not operate a user-to-user service.
    Policy line: “We do not host a federated server. Any social accounts are off site and subject to their own terms.”

    Mirrored high-risk sections in a separate repo or subdomain
    Why it survives: you can withdraw or archive a mirror fast if law changes.
    Policy line: “Some archives may be mirrored. We may remove or relocate a mirror if required by law.”

    No third-party embeds by default, host assets locally
    Why it survives: eliminates pixels, cookies, and processor disclosures.
    Policy line: “Fonts, scripts, and media are hosted locally. No third-party widgets by default.”

    Strict device-access rule
    Why it survives: keeps you out of cookie banner territory.
    Policy line: “Any device information read during a page view is used only to render that page, not stored and not sent to analytics.”

    Integrity and provenance
    Why it survives: reduces false-tampering claims and improves trust without adding tracking.
    Policy line: “We publish SHA-256 checksums for downloads. No tracking is added.”

B. Tiny, production-ready snippets

    Click-to-load embed wrapper, no persistence



<figure>
  <button type="button" aria-controls="ext-1">
    Load external video
  </button>
  <div id="ext-1" data-src="https://example.com/embed/xyz" hidden></div>
  <figcaption>External media loads only after you click.</figcaption>
</figure>
<script>
document.addEventListener('click', e => {
  if (e.target.matches('button[aria-controls]')) {
    const id = e.target.getAttribute('aria-controls');
    const host = document.getElementById(id);
    if (host && host.hasAttribute('data-src') && host.hidden) {
      const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
      iframe.src = host.getAttribute('data-src');
      iframe.setAttribute('title', 'External media');
      iframe.setAttribute('loading', 'lazy');
      iframe.setAttribute('referrerpolicy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');
      iframe.setAttribute('allow', 'fullscreen');
      host.appendChild(iframe);
      host.hidden = false;
    }
  }
});
</script>




Local, site-only search with a static index
Build a small JSON index at deploy time. Load it locally and filter in memory. No network calls beyond your own domain, no cookies, no telemetry.







<input id="q" type="search" placeholder="Search this site">
<ul id="results" aria-live="polite"></ul>
<script>
let idx=[]; // [{t:"Title",u:"/path",k:"keywords text"}]
fetch('/index.json',{cache:'no-store'}).then(r=>r.json()).then(j=>idx=j);
document.getElementById('q').addEventListener('input', e=>{
  const q=e.target.value.trim().toLowerCase();
  const out=document.getElementById('results'); out.innerHTML='';
  if(!q) return;
  const hits=idx.filter(x=>x.k.includes(q)).slice(0,20);
  for(const h of hits){
    const li=document.createElement('li');
    const a=document.createElement('a'); a.href=h.u; a.textContent=h.t;
    li.appendChild(a); out.appendChild(li);
  }
});
</script>




Generate index.json during your build from page titles plus plain-text content. Store nothing on the device.

    RSS feed starter (Atom works too)

C. Drop-in HTML section to add to your scope page

Paste this into scope_and_changes.html under a new heading.






<section id="low-risk-strategies" aria-labelledby="low-risk-strategies-h">
  <h2 id="low-risk-strategies-h">Low-risk interaction strategies we use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Mail-to-publish letters. Curated, edited, never auto-published.</li>
    <li>Periodic digests. Edited summaries on a schedule, not live threads.</li>
    <li>PR-to-publish with manual merge. Editorial control, not automatic.</li>
    <li>Read-only Q&amp;A. Questions by email, answers published as static pages.</li>
    <li>Local, site-only search. Runs in your browser, no external calls, no cookies.</li>
    <li>Click-to-load embeds. External media loads only after you click, no saved preference.</li>
    <li>RSS and JSON Feed. No mailing lists, no tracking.</li>
    <li>No third-party widgets by default. Assets are hosted locally.</li>
    <li>Strict device-access rule. Any device info read is used only to render that page, not stored.</li>
    <li>Integrity checks. SHA-256 checksums for downloadable files.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These patterns keep this site outside regulated user-to-user scope, avoid non-essential cookies or similar technologies, and minimize third-party processing.</p>
</section>




D. Operational guardrails to keep everything durable

    Feature gate. Maintain a single boolean flag in code that disables optional scripts.

    Two builds, strict and full. Strict has only HTML and CSS.

    No persistent preferences. If you ever add them, add a real consent flow with equal Accept and Reject and block until choice.

    No third-party embeds by default. If you must embed, use click-to-load.

    Keep the “scope and changes” page current, with a dated changelog.

If you want, I can bundle these into a single PR: a new low-risk-strategies section added to your scope page, a tiny local search index script, and a one-file RSS feed.
