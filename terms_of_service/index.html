  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-08-12</p>

  <h2>1. About this site</h2>
  <p>This is a static, content-only website operated as Taichiman on the domain taichi800.github.io. There are no user accounts, no comments, no forums, no multi-site search, and no advertising. The site is intended for general information and education.</p>

  <h2>2. Acceptance of these terms</h2>
  <p>By accessing or using the site, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the site.</p>

  <h2>3. Scope of permitted use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may view the pages and download copies for personal use that complies with the licenses stated on the site.</li>
    <li>You will not attempt to disrupt, overload, or interfere with the site or its hosting platform.</li>
    <li>You will not use automated scraping that degrades service or circumvents technical measures. Reasonable caching by browsers and search engines is acceptable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. No accounts and no user-to-user features</h2>
  <p>The site does not provide account registration, profiles, public comments, messaging, uploads, or any feature where one userâ€™s content is published for another user to encounter on this site.</p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual property and licenses</h2>
  <p>Unless a page or file states otherwise, the site content is protected by copyright. The specific license for each class of material is described in the repository files <code>LICENSE</code> and <code>LICENSES.md</code>, and may also be noted within folders. No license is granted beyond those terms. Trademarks, service marks, and logos remain the property of their respective owners.</p>

  <h2>6. Submissions by email for possible publication</h2>
  <p>The site may invite readers to send comments by email for possible inclusion in a periodic letters page that is curated and published as static HTML. Nothing you send is automatically published.</p>
  <p>By emailing a submission that you mark for possible publication, you confirm that you have the rights to the material you send, that it does not infringe third-party rights, and that it does not include confidential or personal information about others without permission. You grant Taichiman a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to edit for clarity and length and to publish the submission or excerpts as part of the site and its archives. You can withdraw consent for future displays by email request, after which the material will be removed from live pages where reasonably practicable. This does not require removal from backups created before the request.</p>

  <h2>7. Health and safety disclaimer</h2>
  <p>Content about Tai Chi and related subjects is informational only. It is not medical advice. Consult a qualified professional before beginning any new exercise or health practice. Use your own judgment and follow local safety guidance.</p>

  <h2>8. Third-party services and links</h2>
  <p>The site aims to host fonts, scripts, and media locally. If a page links to third-party sites, those sites operate under their own terms and privacy policies. The operator is not responsible for third-party content or practices.</p>

  <h2>9. Availability and changes</h2>
  <p>The site may change, suspend, or discontinue pages at any time without notice. There is no uptime or support guarantee.</p>

  <h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>The site and all content are provided as is and as available, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

  <h2>11. Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the operator shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising from or related to your use of the site. To the extent any liability is found, the total liability for all claims will not exceed ten United States dollars.</p>

  <h2>12. Indemnity for submissions</h2>
  <p>You agree to defend and indemnify the operator against claims that your emailed submission, if published at your request, infringes the rights of others or violates applicable law.</p>

  <h2>13. Privacy<
