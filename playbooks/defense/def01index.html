Basic Self-Defense Module Guide
--------------------------------

1. Introduction to Self-Defense:
   - What is self-defense?
   - Why is it important to know self-defense?

2. Awareness:
   - Understanding your surroundings.
   - How to stay alert and aware to prevent dangerous situations.

3. Basic Stance and Posture:
   - Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart.
   - Keep your knees slightly bent.
   - Hands up in front of you, ready to protect yourself.

4. Simple Defensive Moves:
   - Palm Strike: Use the base of your palm to strike the attacker’s nose or chin.
   - Elbow Strike: If close, use your elbow to hit the attacker in the chest or face.
   - Knee Kick: Bring your knee up forcefully to hit the attacker's stomach or groin if very close.

5. Escape Techniques:
   - How to break free from an arm grab.
   - Techniques to move away from a bear hug.

6. Safety Tips:
   - Always be aware of exit routes.
   - Avoid wearing headphones in unsafe areas.
   - Trust your instincts—if something feels wrong, find a way to leave.

7. Practice:
   - Regularly practice these moves with a partner using light contact.
   - Join a self-defense class to improve skills and confidence.

Remember: The goal of self-defense is not to fight, but to escape and get to safety.

Escape Techniques:
------------------

1. How to Break Free from an Arm Grab:
   - Step 1: Stay Calm and Assess the Grip - Recognize which arm is grabbed and how tight the grip is.
   - Step 2: Bend Your Arm - Quickly bend the arm that's grabbed towards your body to create leverage and reduce the grabber's grip strength.
   - Step 3: Use Your Free Hand - Bring your free hand to assist by grabbing your other hand or wrist. This multiplies your strength for the next step.
   - Step 4: Twist and Pull - Swiftly twist your grabbed arm towards the thumb side of the grabber's hand. The thumb is usually the weakest part of someone’s grip, making it easier to slip out.
   - Step 5: Step Back or Sideways - As you pull your arm free, move your body in the opposite direction to create distance immediately.

2. Techniques to Move Away from a Bear Hug:
   - Bear Hug from Behind (Arms Free):
     - Step 1: Drop Your Weight - Bend your knees and drop your center of gravity; this makes it harder for the attacker to lift you and gives you more stability.
     - Step 2: Stomp and Kick - Use your heels to stomp on the attacker's feet and your legs to kick backward toward the attacker's knees or shins.
     - Step 3: Elbow Strikes - Use your elbows to hit the attacker's face, chest, or stomach. Aim for sensitive areas to maximize impact.
     - Step 4: Turn Into the Attacker - Once you've created some space, quickly turn to face the attacker, which can help you transition to other defensive moves.

   - Bear Hug from Front (Arms Pinned):
     - Step 1: Protect Your Head - Tuck your chin down to protect your neck and to safeguard against falls.
     - Step 2: Lower Your Stance - Like before, drop your center of gravity to make lifting difficult.
     - Step 3: Pelvic Thrust - Thrust your hips outward forcefully. This action can unbalance the attacker and loosen their grip.
     - Step 4: Attack Vulnerable Areas - If your hands are free, target sensitive areas such as the eyes, nose, or throat with strikes.
     - Step 5: Use Your Weight - Lean forward and use your body weight to force the attacker to step back, helping you gain momentum to break free.
