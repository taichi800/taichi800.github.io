Starting Position:

Lie on your back on your yoga mat with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.
Position your arms alongside your body with your palms facing down.
Foot and Leg Alignment:

Place your feet close enough to your hips so you can touch your heels with your fingertips. This helps ensure proper alignment and stability.
Keep your knees aligned with your hips and avoid letting them splay outwards or collapse inwards.
Preparing for the Lift:

Press firmly through your feet and engage your core muscles to support your lower back.
Inhale deeply to prepare for the lift.
Lifting the Hips:

As you exhale, press through your feet and lift your hips towards the ceiling. Engage your glutes and hamstrings to assist with the lift.
Keep your thighs parallel to each other and your knees aligned over your ankles.
Supporting the Pose:

Place a yoga block or bolster under your sacrum for support. Ensure that the block or bolster is positioned securely and comfortably to support your lower back and pelvis.
Adjust the height of the block or bolster to a level that feels comfortable and stable for you.
Arm and Shoulder Positioning:

Keep your arms alongside your body with your palms facing down, pressing gently into the mat for additional support.
Alternatively, you can interlace your fingers beneath your back and gently roll your shoulders under to open your chest further.
Spine and Hip Alignment:

Ensure that your spine remains long and neutral, avoiding any overarching of the lower back.
Keep your hips level and your chest lifted, maintaining a smooth, continuous line from your shoulders to your knees.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Inhale to lengthen your spine and create space, and exhale to relax into the pose.
Use your breath to help release any tension and maintain a steady focus.
Modifications for Comfort:

If you experience discomfort in your lower back or knees, adjust the height of the support or place a folded blanket under your shoulders for additional cushioning.
Keep your feet hip-width apart or slightly wider if needed for stability and comfort.
Mindfulness and Relaxation:

Focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this pose to relax and release tension in your back and hips.
Stay present in the moment and avoid pushing yourself too hard. Listen to your body and respect your limits.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Gradually increase the duration as your comfort and stability improve.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, press firmly through your feet and gently lift your hips to remove the block or bolster.
Slowly lower your spine back down to the mat, one vertebra at a time, and rest in a neutral position with your knees bent.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have severe neck, shoulder, or back injuries. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
