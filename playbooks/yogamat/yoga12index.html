Starting Position:

Begin in a seated position with your legs extended straight in front of you. Sit on a folded blanket or cushion if needed to ensure your spine is straight and your hips are level.
Positioning the Legs:

Bend your right knee and place your right foot flat on the floor outside your left thigh. Your right knee should point up towards the ceiling.
Bend your left knee and tuck your left foot near your right hip. If this is uncomfortable, you can keep your left leg extended straight on the floor.
Spine Alignment:

Sit up tall, lengthening your spine. Ensure your pelvis is neutral, and avoid rounding your back.
Engage your core muscles to support your lower back and maintain an upright posture.
Arm Positioning:

Inhale and lift your left arm up to lengthen your spine further.
Exhale and twist to the right, bringing your left elbow to the outside of your right knee. Place your right hand on the floor behind you for support.
Deepening the Twist:

Use your left elbow against your right knee to help deepen the twist. Avoid forcing the twist; instead, use each inhale to lengthen your spine and each exhale to twist deeper.
Keep your head in line with your spine, gazing over your right shoulder or straight ahead if that feels better for your neck.
Maintaining Proper Alignment:

Ensure that your hips remain level and that your right foot stays flat on the floor.
Keep your shoulders relaxed and away from your ears. Avoid hunching your shoulders as you twist.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Inhale to lengthen your spine and create space, and exhale to twist deeper.
Focus on expanding your chest and breathing into the twist.
Modifications for Comfort:

If you have difficulty reaching your elbow to your knee, use a strap around your thigh to assist with the twist.
If the full twist is too intense, you can place your hand on your knee instead of using your elbow to deepen the twist.
Mindfulness and Relaxation:

Close your eyes and focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this pose to connect with your inner self and find calmness.
Stay present in the moment and avoid pushing yourself too hard. Listen to your body and respect your limits.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Gradually increase the duration as your flexibility and comfort improve.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, inhale to lengthen your spine and exhale to slowly release the twist.
Repeat the pose on the other side, switching the position of your legs and twisting to the left.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have spinal injuries or severe back problems. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
