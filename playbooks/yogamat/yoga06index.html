<pre>

Starting Position:

Begin in a high plank position with your wrists directly under your shoulders and your body forming a straight line from head to heels.
Engage your core and glutes to maintain a strong and stable plank.
Hand and Arm Placement:

Position your hands shoulder-width apart, with your fingers spread wide and pressing evenly through your palms.
Keep your elbows close to your body as you lower down, forming a 90-degree angle with your elbows pointing backwards, not outwards.
Leg and Foot Positioning:

Keep your legs together or hip-width apart, pressing through the balls of your feet.
Engage your quadriceps to lift your kneecaps and maintain a strong, straight line from your heels to the crown of your head.
Lowering into Low Plank:

On an exhale, begin to lower your body towards the mat by bending your elbows. Keep your body in a straight line as you lower, ensuring that your shoulders, hips, and heels remain aligned.
Avoid letting your hips sag or pike up. Your shoulders should not dip lower than your elbows.
Shoulder and Neck Position:

Keep your shoulders drawn back and down, away from your ears, to avoid unnecessary tension.
Keep your neck in a neutral position by gazing slightly forward, not dropping your head towards the mat.
Core Engagement:

Engage your core muscles to support your lower back and maintain stability throughout the pose.
Draw your navel towards your spine to activate your deep abdominal muscles.
Breathing:

Maintain a steady and controlled breath throughout the pose. Inhale as you prepare in high plank and exhale as you lower into low plank.
Avoid holding your breath, which can increase tension and reduce stability.
Modifications for Comfort and Safety:

If you are new to Chaturanga or find it challenging, lower your knees to the mat for a modified version. Ensure that your body remains in a straight line from your head to your knees.
You can also practice lowering only partway down or use a bolster or yoga blocks under your chest for additional support.
Mindfulness and Alignment:

Focus on maintaining proper alignment and form rather than lowering too quickly or deeply. Quality over quantity is key to preventing injury.
Regularly check in with your body and make adjustments as needed to ensure you are engaging the correct muscles and maintaining alignment.
Transitioning to Other Poses:

To transition out of low plank, you can either lower all the way to the mat into a prone position for a pose like Cobra or upward-facing dog or push back up into high plank and then move into Downward Dog.
Ensure smooth and controlled movements to maintain stability and alignment.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have shoulder, wrist, or lower back injuries. Always listen to your body and consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns.
Practice with caution if you have conditions that affect your core strength or stability.
