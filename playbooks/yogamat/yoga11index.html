Starting Position:

Begin in Mountain Pose (Tadasana) with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Find a focal point in front of you to help maintain balance.
Establishing Balance:

Shift your weight onto your left foot. Firmly root your left foot into the mat, engaging the leg muscles to create a strong foundation.
Lifting the Right Leg:

Bend your right knee and lift your right foot towards your buttocks. Reach back with your right hand and grasp the inside of your right ankle.
Keep your right knee pointing down towards the floor, and avoid letting it splay out to the side.
Arm and Torso Positioning:

Extend your left arm forward, parallel to the floor, with your palm facing down or up for balance.
Engage your core muscles to support your spine and maintain an upright torso.
Kicking Back and Up:

Begin to press your right foot into your right hand, kicking back and up to lift your leg higher. Simultaneously, reach your left arm forward and slightly up to counterbalance.
Keep your chest lifted and your gaze steady on your focal point.
Spine and Hip Alignment:

Ensure that your hips remain square to the front, avoiding any twisting.
Lengthen through your spine, lifting your chest while keeping your lower back long and supported.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Inhale to lengthen your spine and create space, and exhale to deepen the pose.
Use your breath to help maintain balance and focus.
Adjusting for Comfort:

If you find it difficult to reach your foot, use a strap around your ankle to extend your reach.
If you experience discomfort in your lower back or shoulders, ease out of the pose slightly and focus on maintaining proper alignment.
Mindfulness and Focus:

Stay present in the moment and focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this pose to cultivate concentration and balance.
Avoid pushing yourself too hard. Listen to your body and respect your limits.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 5-10 deep breaths.
Gradually increase the duration as your balance and flexibility improve.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, slowly release your right foot and lower it back to the mat.
Return to Mountain Pose and take a few breaths before repeating the pose on the other side.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have knee, hip, or lower back injuries. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
Modifications and Variations:
For Beginners: Use a wall or chair for support to help maintain balance. Use a strap around your ankle if you cannot reach your foot.
For a Deeper Stretch: Lift your back leg higher and reach your opposite arm further forward to deepen the stretch.
