Starting Position:

Begin by lying flat on your back on your yoga mat. Ensure your spine is straight and your body is aligned.
Positioning the Legs:

Bend your right knee and draw it towards your chest. Keep your left leg extended on the mat with the toes pointing upward.
Place a strap around the arch of your right foot if you cannot comfortably reach your toes with your hand.
Foot and Leg Alignment:

Hold the strap or grasp your right big toe with the first two fingers and thumb of your right hand.
Extend your right leg upwards towards the ceiling. Straighten your leg as much as possible without straining, keeping a slight bend in the knee if necessary.
Supporting the Hips and Lower Back:

Ensure your pelvis remains grounded and level on the mat. Avoid lifting your hips or lower back off the floor.
Engage your core muscles to support your lower back and maintain stability.
Arm and Hand Positioning:

Extend your left arm out to the side at shoulder height, palm facing down, to help with balance and stability.
Use your right hand to hold the strap or your big toe, keeping your right arm straight but not locked at the elbow.
Spine and Hip Alignment:

Keep your spine long and your lower back pressed gently into the mat.
Ensure your hips are squared and your left leg remains active with the toes pointing upwards.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Inhale to lengthen your spine and create space, and exhale to relax into the stretch.
Use your breath to help release any tension and deepen the pose gradually.
Modifications for Comfort:

If you cannot reach your foot comfortably, use a yoga strap or belt around your foot to extend your reach.
Place a folded blanket or bolster under your head and neck for additional support if needed.
Mindfulness and Relaxation:

Focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this pose to relax and release tension in your hamstrings and lower back.
Stay present in the moment and avoid pushing yourself too hard. Listen to your body and respect your limits.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Gradually increase the duration as your flexibility and comfort improve.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, slowly lower your right leg back to the mat.
Repeat the pose on the other side, bending your left knee and extending your left leg upwards.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have severe lower back, hip, or hamstring injuries. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
Modifications and Variations:
For Beginners: Use a yoga strap around your foot for assistance, and keep a slight bend in your knee.
For a Deeper Stretch: Extend your leg fully and reach your foot with your hand if possible. You can also try to pull your leg closer to your torso for a deeper stretch.
