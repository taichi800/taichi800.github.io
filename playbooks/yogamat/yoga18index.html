Exhale: Uttanasana (Standing Forward Bend):

Movement: Hinge at your hips and fold forward, bringing your hands to the mat, shins, or ankles.

Safety Tips:
Warm-Up: Ensure you are adequately warmed up before starting the sequence to prevent injuries.
Modify as Needed: Use props such as blocks or straps if you need extra support or flexibility. Modify poses to suit your body and avoid strain.
Listen to Your Body: Pay attention to how your body feels during each pose. Avoid pushing into pain and respect your limits.
Maintain Proper Alignment: Focus on maintaining alignment to protect your joints and muscles. Use a mirror or a friend to check your form if needed.
Breath Awareness: Coordinate your movements with your breath, ensuring smooth and even breathing throughout the sequence.
