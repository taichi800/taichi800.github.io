Starting Position:

Begin in a seated position on your yoga mat with your legs extended in front of you (Dandasana).
Sit on a folded blanket or cushion if needed to ensure your spine is straight and your hips are level.
Warm-Up:

It is essential to warm up your hips, knees, and ankles before attempting Lotus Pose. Perform gentle hip openers such as Bound Angle Pose (Baddha Konasana), Head-to-Knee Pose (Janu Sirsasana), and Pigeon Pose (Eka Pada Rajakapotasana).
Leg Positioning:

Bend your right knee and place your right foot on your left thigh, close to the hip crease. The sole of your foot should face upward, and your heel should be close to your abdomen.
Bend your left knee and lift your left foot over your right shin, placing it on your right thigh in a similar manner. Adjust your feet and legs to find a comfortable position without forcing your knees.
Spine Alignment:

Sit up tall, lengthening your spine and lifting your chest. Ensure your pelvis is neutral, and avoid rounding your back.
Engage your core muscles to support your lower back and maintain an upright posture.
Arm and Hand Placement:

Rest your hands on your knees with your palms facing upward. You can use a mudra, such as Gyan Mudra (touching the thumb and index finger together), to enhance focus and calmness.
Keep your shoulders relaxed and away from your ears.
Maintaining Proper Alignment:

Ensure that both knees are close to the floor and your feet are comfortable. Avoid forcing your knees down or pulling your feet up if it causes discomfort.
Keep your spine long and your head in line with your spine, gazing straight ahead or closing your eyes.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Inhale to lengthen your spine and create space, and exhale to relax into the pose.
Use your breath to help maintain relaxation and focus.
Modifications for Comfort:

If you cannot comfortably get into full Lotus Pose, practice Half Lotus Pose (Ardha Padmasana) by placing one foot on the opposite thigh and keeping the other foot under the opposite knee.
Use props such as blankets or blocks under your knees for additional support if needed.
Mindfulness and Relaxation:

Focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this pose for meditation and mindfulness practices.
Stay present in the moment and avoid pushing yourself too hard. Listen to your body and respect your limits.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 1-5 minutes, gradually increasing the duration as your flexibility and comfort improve.
It is essential to switch the cross of your legs halfway through your practice if you are holding the pose for an extended period to maintain balance.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, gently lift your feet off your thighs and extend your legs out in front of you.
Shake out your legs and perform gentle stretches to release any tension in your hips and knees.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have knee, hip, or ankle injuries. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
