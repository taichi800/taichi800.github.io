    <h1>Privacy and Device Access</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-08-12</p>

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>This is a static, content-only site. There are no accounts, no comments, no forums, no multi-site search, and no advertising.</p>

    <h2>What we do not do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No analytics, no tracking pixels, no advertising tags.</li>
      <li>No non-essential cookies, no localStorage, no IndexedDB, no fingerprinting.</li>
      <li>No third-party embeds by default. All fonts, scripts, and media are hosted locally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Device access for features you request</h2>
    <p>Some pages may read limited device information during your visit to provide a feature you request, for example showing local time. This access is <em>session-only</em>. We do not store the value across visits and we do not send it to analytics or third parties.</p>
    <p>If a feature ever needs persistent storage, we will ask first and it will be strictly opt-in.</p>

    <h2>Personal data we handle</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personal data on this site. The only personal data we process is what you choose to send by email.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Correspondence:</strong> When you email us, we process your message to read and reply. If you explicitly submit a letter for possible publication, we may publish edited excerpts as described in our Interaction Policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal or safety notices:</strong> If we receive a takedown or safety notice, we may retain related correspondence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal bases for processing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> when you ask us to publish a letter or otherwise request a specific action.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> running a secure, simple website and responding to inquiries.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal obligation:</strong> where law requires us to keep certain records.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hosting and logs</h2>
    <p>This site is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub may process IP addresses and basic request data in server logs to operate the service. We do not receive raw access logs and we do not profile visitors. For GitHub’s practices, see the GitHub Privacy Statement.</p>

    <h2>Data sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal data. We share correspondence only if required by law or to investigate abuse or security incidents.</p>

    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>General correspondence: keep up to 12 months, then delete.</li>
      <li>Published letters and editorial notes: kept as part of the public archive unless you withdraw consent.</li>
      <li>Legal or safety notices: retained as required by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>Where applicable under UK GDPR or EU GDPR, you can request access, correction, deletion, or restriction of your personal data, and you can object to processing. You can withdraw consent at any time. You also have the right to complain to a data protection authority, for example the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>This site is not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. Parents or guardians can contact us to remove correspondence.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Email: <a href="mailto:taichiman@tutamail.com">taichiman@tutamail.com</a></p>
    <p>When contacting us about privacy, include “Privacy” in the subject line.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>If we change how we process data or use device storage, we will update this page and note the effective date.</p>
